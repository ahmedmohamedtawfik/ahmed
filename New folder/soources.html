    <p>Energy sources refer to the different means used to generate power or electricity.
         There are numerous types of energy sources, and they can be categorized as renewable or non-renewable sources
          depending on their availability and environmental impact.
           Non-renewable sources include fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas,
            which are finite resources and emit greenhouse gases when burned, contributing to climate change.
             On the other hand, renewable sources such as solar, wind, hydropower, and geothermal
              are constantly replenished and emit little to no greenhouse gases.
               Despite their numerous benefits, the integration of renewable energy into the grid
                has its challenges, such as intermittent supply and costs.
                 Nonetheless, the transition to renewable sources is crucial to combat climate change and ensure
                  a sustainable future.
